This was a small project from a front-end development class I took my junior year of college.
This is a fitness web-application that allows users to search their desired exercises and create a workout for each day of the year.
Users can add sets, repetitions, and edit whether the set is complete or not.

## Instructions
First, users create an account or log in to an existing account. Then, by clicking on the add button in the middle of the page,
users can search an exercise they would like to add to their daily workout. By clicking on each rep, users can indicate
whether that set is finished or not. Clicking all sets will complete that exercise. Users can also change the date of the workout
by clicking on the arrows at the top of the page.
