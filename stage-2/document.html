    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <section>
    <p>Problem Description</p>
        <p>One area that I am very passionate about is fitness. I feel as though lifting weights is one 
        thing that many people know about and may even want to get started on, but don't really have 
        any direction or understanding on where to start. Many people struggle with their mental health,
        weight, and overall health and I feel that introducting this aspect of fitness into their lives can
        benefit and help them in numerous different ways. I feel as though on the internet, there aren't 
        any websites or applications that allow for people to find everything they need to start lifting 
        weights and exercising without having to navigate through many different resources which takes time
        and effort that a lot of people just don't have. It is really a struggle to learn these things and 
        it can be especially hard to pay for an athletic trainer, especially at big corporations such as
        LA Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness, where they charge huge amounts to clients (for trainers)
        without much offered reward. I could not find any existing solutions online, which was actually
        pretty surprising to me. There were mobile applications though, although many still don't offer
        the functionalities and ease of access that I want to enable people to have. Lifting weights has many 
        benefits such as improved bone-density, fat-free body mass, posture, mental-health, sleep, regulation of 
        insulin, and much more.

        <p>App Description</p>
        <p> The users of this application would be anyone who wants to learn how to lift weights or make this 
            change in their lifestyle. With the web app, I would like users to have the ability to learn how
            to lift weights without all the confusing and annoying research required to understand how to be
            successful. In my app, I would like to start by asking users questions about themselves such as 
            reasons for wanting to begin lifting, time-commitments, and etc. After getting to know a little
            bit about the user, I would give users the option of making an account so they can keep track of 
            their data. Then, users will be able to make a weekly workout routine based on what they want to do,
            although there would be some guidelines so they can't do too little or too much. I was thinking that 
            depending on the amount of days per week they can workout and how much time they can commit to each 
            workout, they could make up different plans for themselves through the guidance of the app. Also,
            I wanted to figure out a way to model the anatomy of a human and show each muscle so that they can
            also choose workouts based on which muscles they want to focus on the most. For example some kind of function
            that allows for users to click a muscle and be given different exercises that target that muscle.
            The amount of things I could add to an app like this are really large so I have many ideas of how to 
            put something like this together.

        <p>App Functionality</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First users will be shown questions asking them about their experience with fitness,
                their goals, how much time they want to dedicate, etc.
            </li>
            <li>After users finish the slides of questions, they will be taken to a page where they 
                are given the option to make an account with their email or to skip (not sure if 
                I want people to have to have an account as mandatory or not).
            </li>
            <li>Transition to a "home" page with different options such as:
                    <ul>
                            <li>Create a new weekly workout routine</li>

                            <li>Informational pages?</li>
                            <li>More page ideas once I completely understand scope of project?</li>
                          </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
